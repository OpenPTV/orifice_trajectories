### How to plot this data:

1. Unzip the set (1-5)
2. Using Matlab:

change the location of the directory on line 19 of ```myTraj_Alex ```:

    name=['./set1/trajPoint.',num2Str(i)];

change the first and last file: 

    first=	1;
    last = 5000;

and run the file: 

    >> myTraj_Alex
    
    
You should get something of this kind (probably rotated to a top view, use Matlab figure toolbar to rotate the view):

The data is stored in ```trajPoint``` files which are explained here: <https://github.com/3dptv/3d-ptv-post-process/tree/master/doc>



using PostPTV (the example is not yet ready, modify <https://github.com/OpenPTV/postptv/blob/master/examples/hdf5_scene_analysis.ipynb>
